# 3 phishing

With [evilginx](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2) you can easily deploy a phinshing site.
See also [this blogpost](https://breakdev.org/evilginx-2-next-generation-of-phishing-2fa-tokens/).

We will start an outlook phishing site (only available from the workshop IP range): open 
https://outlook.outlook.lekkervissen.nl/smaGRvAp and log in (with a test account!).

If you have a security key registered (see the previous exercises), try to login using your security key.
